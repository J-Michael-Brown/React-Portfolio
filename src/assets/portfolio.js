      notes: [
        'When I was seven years old, I went up to the piano in the lobby of the church me and my family went to. I played of few of the keys and tried to make a sound that I recognized by playing a couple more. My mother saw me and, reminded of how she wished how she learned an instrument when she was little, decided to get me a piano teacher. I would go on to begin taking music lessons for the rest of my adolescent life, even picking up the guitar when I was nine. ',
        ' After a while I didn\'t enjoy it very much. Practicing classical music way too much just wasn\'t very fun. In the interst of my willingness to keep going at music, my piano teacher had me look for some music that I would like to play. I wasn\'t much for listening to the music my sister would blast from her room, and no videogame music had really sparked my interest up to that point. Recalling some movie I\'d seen I asked for a jazz station (thinking of somethink boppy and fast) but what I was greeted with was slower and very much not what I was looking for, and I couldn\'t describe it well to ask for the right thing. Determined to listen to that thing I had a vague recollection of, I decided to persue jazz music anyways, in the hopes that I could at least be able to play it myself. It was a very enlightening experience learning jazz after having spent so much time with classical styles of music (I could go on for a while about this but I won\'t unless you ask me). One of the more interesting discoveries I made was that I don\'t like listening to every type of music that I enjoyed playing. Slow and smoothe jazz music is really popular, but I don\'t personally like it but I did enjoy playing any jazz chord in any piece. ',
        ' I don\'t play music myself anymore but I do have a growing interest in why people like any given type of music as compared to any other type.'
