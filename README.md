## Description

Information about myself, including: my projects on Git, my personal and technical interests, along with my educational history.

## Setup and Installation
Here are some links in case you need information about setup for other operating systems:  
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/);

(If you cannot install node you still need to install Git's [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your device)

## Known Bugs

* No bugs yet, I'll get some soon

## Support and contact details
_If you run into any issues or have questions, ideas or concerns, or if you want to make a contribution to the code. You can email me_
